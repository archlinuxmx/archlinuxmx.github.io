# Hugo Theme Arch

## Get the source code

I assume you've Git installed. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/syui/hugo-theme-arch
$ cd hugo-theme-arch
```

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
# install hugo
$ sudo pacman -S go
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
$ go get -v github.com/spf13/hugo

# build
$ hugo

# preview
$ hugo server
------------------------
$ curl -sL localhost:1313
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](//localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
